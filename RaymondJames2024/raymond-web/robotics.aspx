                The idea of robots powered by artificial intelligence has fascinated and ignited our imaginations for decades. Today, robotics ideas that were once science fiction are becoming reality for many businesses. 
                <br /><br />
Companies are using AI-powered robots to bring humans and technology closer together, solve problems, and transform their business models to meet changing demands.
                <br /><br />
For example, AI-enabled robots greet customers in stores and provide them with personalized information and directions. They harvest ripe vegetables in farm fields and serve made-to-order lattes in coffee shops. In industrial settings, AI-enabled robots keep workers safe by operating in shared spaces. They also perform complex tasks such as cutting, grinding, welding and inspection autonomously.
                <br /><br />
<h1>What Are AI-Powered Robots?</h1>
AI-powered robots are augmented with a variety of sensors (including vision devices such as 2D/3D cameras, vibration sensors, proximity sensors, accelerometers, and other environmental sensors,) that feed them with sensing data they can analyze and act upon in real-time.
                <br /><br />
To better understand what AI-enabled robots are, it’s important to understand what makes them intelligent.
                <br /><br />
Artificial intelligence refers to a broad class of systems that enable machines to mimic advanced human capabilities. 
                <br /><br />
                <h1>Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)</h1>

As AMRs move through their environments, AI enables them to:
                <br />
-  Capture information through 3D cameras and LiDAR sensors<br />
- Analyze the gathered information<br />
- Make inferences based on their environment and overall mission<br />
- Move or act to deliver the best outcome<br />
- Depending on the industry, the tasks and actions completed by AI-empowered AMRs vary widely. For example, when moving inventory from one point to another in a warehouse, AMRs can avoid collisions by navigating around human workers or fallen boxes while simultaneously determining the optimal path for task completion. Learn more about AMRs and how they are being used.
                <br /><br />
<h1>Articulated Robots (Robotic Arms)</h1>

AI allows articulated robots to perform tasks faster and more accurately. AI technologies infer information from vision sensors, such as 2D/3D cameras, to segment and understand scenes as well as detect and classify objects. Learn more about articulated robots and robotic arms.
                <br /><br />
<h1>Cobots</h1>

AI allows cobots to respond to and learn from human speech and gestures without worker-assisted training.<br />
Learn more about the different types of robots and how they’re used across various industries.<br />
                <br /><br />
<h1>Benefits of Integrating AI</h1>
While integrating artificial intelligence with an existing operation or business model appears overwhelming at first, the benefits realized typically far outweigh the challenges experienced. 
                <br /><br />
<h1>Increased Productivity and Efficiency</h1>

Companies today are juggling more demands than ever before. Customers want faster delivery. Stakeholders want higher productivity and increased efficiency. And workers want to contribute without fatigue or injury. AI robots are helping on all fronts. They perform repetitive or time-consuming tasks, such as checking inventory and alerting staff to out-of-stock or misplaced items in retail environments. This expedites product delivery, improves productivity, and frees human workers to take on higher-level, less physically taxing tasks, such as looking for ways to improve processes, troubleshooting AMR issues, or developing new ideas. 
                <br /><br />
<h1>Improved Quality and Accuracy</h1>
              
AI robots can see and understand their environments, which enables them to complete complex tasks such as quality-control inspections on assembly lines. In industrial applications, AI robots can check the quality of goods inline, instead of delaying the task to the end of the process—saving time and money for the manufacturer. Read how Audi partnered with Intel and Nebbiolo Technologies to boost weld inspections and enhance quality-control processes with Intel-enabled robotic arms, machine learning, and predictive analytics.1
                <br /><br />
<h1>Enhanced Worker Safety</h1>

AI robots play a major role in improving workplace safety. Companies in the oil and gas sector often use them to perform data collection or safety inspection tasks in dangerous environments to reduce risk to humans. And because AI-enabled robots can learn from human gestures and speech, they’re able to continuously improve their ability to complete their tasks while safely working alongside employees.
