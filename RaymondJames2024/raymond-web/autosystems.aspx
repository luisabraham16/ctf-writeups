             Autonomous systems include a wide variety of technologies: from thinking machines that can outgame humans in contests such as chess; to drones that enable scanning physical, natural, and social environments; to self-driving vehicles; to robots that work on manufacturing lines. Watson and Scheidt (2005) define autonomous systems as “…systems that can change their behavior in response to unanticipated events during operation” (p. 368). Fundamental to such systems is the incorporation of intelligence—the ability to perceive, process, remember, learn, and determine courses of action as a result of the integration of these processes. Famously, Wiener (1948) coined the term “cybernetics” as an early foray into the domain of artificial intelligence (AI), noting that computing machines not only could mimic human cognitive processing but also could improve upon it by incorporating redundant processing mechanisms to reduce errors. Moreover, drawing on evolutionary theory and classic game theory (e.g., Darwin, 1859; von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944), Wiener proposed that machines could learn from past performance to improve future performance. Taking his insights a step further, Wiener also proposed that computing machines could reduce inefficient investments of humans in physical labor and amplify their effectiveness at knowledge work and the arts while also averting risks of subordination to machines (Wiener, 1950). March and Simon (1958) similarly conceptualized the relationship between man and machines in a way that portrayed humans as “adjuncts to machines,” long before this had been coming to fruition.

We can fast-forward from earlier centuries and decades to 1996, when Deep Blue appeared, which was a computer developed by IBM that eventually defeated reigning chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 (e.g., Hsu, 2002). Remarkably, Deep Blue was programmed to remember and process past performance to forecast improved strategies, just as Wiener envisioned. Initially, autonomous systems were not designed for uncertain environments where full information is lacking, but were engineered for more linear environments that entailed perception inputs, logical reasoning, and output planning in the form of both nonkinetic and kinetic acts to achieve some predetermined goal. Now, in only the second decade of the 21st century, we coexist with self-driving cars, drones, and robots with capabilities to transport us, survey terrain, conduct medical diagnoses, administer surgery, generate marketing analyses, execute financial trades, clean our homes, explore deep space, and are even able to recommend military operations (albeit at relatively nascent and experimental stages). As AI has advanced over the last several decades, autonomous systems and agents not only are acting technologies programmed initially for task-specific purposes by humans but also now are learning technologies. That is, just as Wiener predicted, AI is enabling autonomous agents to take input remotely from the environment, synthesize it, develop new ways to approach the problems they are designed to solve, and even discover new problems in need of solutions along the way (e.g., Lemaignan, Warnier, Sisbot, Clodic, & Alami, 2017; Muscettola, Pandurang Nayak, Pell, & Williams, 1998). These new developments are remarkable, if not startling. They are remarkable because of what is now being accomplished by autonomous agents yet startling because learning and cognition are themselves incomplete sciences. The challenges of cognitive science arise, in part, due to the inaccuracies in human reasoning about their environments and the complexity of those environments. The next sections examine current research on learning and cognition in regard to autonomous systems that propose avenues for incorporating this research into the development of autonomous agents and the importance of accounting for the intersection of physical, natural, and social systems in the design of autonomous agents and briefly outline social risks as the science of autonomous systems continues to be developed.
